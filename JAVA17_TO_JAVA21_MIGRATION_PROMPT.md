## Required Migration Plan Structure

Please create a detailed migration plan with the following sections:

### 1. Current State Analysis
- Analyze the provided technology stack
- Document all dependencies and their versions
- Identify code patterns and architecture
- Assess which Java 21 features would be most beneficial
- Create a compatibility matrix for all dependencies

### 2. Java 21 Features Assessment

Evaluate and prioritize these Java 21 features for implementation:

**High Priority** (Clear benefits, minimal risk):
- Virtual Threads (JEP 444) - for improved concurrency
- Sequenced Collections (JEP 431) - for cleaner collection operations
- Pattern Matching for switch (JEP 441) - for cleaner control flow
- Record Patterns (JEP 440) - for better data handling

**Medium Priority** (Selective implementation):
- String Templates (Preview) - for improved string handling
- Unnamed Patterns and Variables (JEP 443) - for cleaner code

**Low Priority** (Future consideration):
- Structured Concurrency (Preview) - for complex async operations
- Scoped Values (Preview) - for thread-local alternatives

For each feature, specify:
- Where it can be applied in the codebase
- Expected benefits
- Implementation complexity
- Any risks or considerations

### 3. Dependency Compatibility Analysis

Create a table analyzing all dependencies:

| Dependency | Current Version | Java 21 Compatible Version | Update Required | Notes |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| [Framework] | [version] | [version] | Yes/No | [compatibility notes] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 4. Detailed Migration Plan

Break down the migration into these phases:

#### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis and Documentation
- Analyze current Java version and features
- Document all dependencies and versions
- Identify code patterns and architecture
- Assess Java 21 feature applicability
- Create compatibility matrix

#### Phase 2: Pre-Migration Preparation
- Create backup branch
- Document current test coverage metrics
- Verify Java 21 JDK installation
- Verify database/external service availability
- Run baseline tests to establish success criteria
- Document current performance metrics

#### Phase 3: Update Build Configuration
- Update build tool configuration for Java 21
- Update compiler settings
- Add Java 21 specific compiler flags if needed
- Verify build tool compatibility

#### Phase 4: Update Dependencies
- Update framework to Java 21 compatible version
- Update all libraries to compatible versions
- Update testing frameworks

- Verify annotation processing compatibility
- Test framework-specific features

#### Phase 7: Build and Compile
- Clean build
- Compile with Java 21
- Validate no compilation errors
- Review and address warnings

#### Phase 8: Run Application
- Start required services (database, etc.)
- Run application with Java 21 runtime
- Verify startup logs
- Check feature activation (e.g., virtual threads)
- Test health/readiness endpoints
- Verify UI/API accessibility

#### Phase 9: Execute Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- API/Contract tests
- End-to-end tests
- Manual testing scenarios
- Verify test coverage maintained

#### Phase 10: Performance Validation
Measure and compare:
- Application startup time
- Memory usage
- Request throughput
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Resource utilization
- Virtual threads effectiveness (if enabled)

#### Phase 11: Documentation Updates
- Update README with Java 21 requirements
- Update technology stack documentation
- Document new features utilized
- Create migration notes
- Update API documentation

- String Templates for logging
- Virtual Threads configuration
- Any other relevant refactorings

### 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Create a risk matrix:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Dependency incompatibility | Low/Medium/High | Low/Medium/High | [mitigation] |
| Test failures | Low/Medium/High | Low/Medium/High | [mitigation] |
| Performance regression | Low/Medium/High | Low/Medium/High | [mitigation] |
| Breaking API changes | Low/Medium/High | Low/Medium/High | [mitigation] |

## Notes

- This template is designed to be comprehensive. Adjust the depth and detail based on your application's complexity.
- Some phases may be combined or reordered based on your specific needs.
- The timeline estimates should be adjusted based on your team's experience and the application's size.
- Consider running a pilot migration on a smaller service first if you have a microservices architecture.
- Always maintain a rollback plan and test thoroughly before production deployment.
